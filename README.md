# 🏫 School Management System (Master)

## 📌 Overview

**School Management System** is a classic **PHP & web-based application** designed to help educational institutions manage everyday administrative tasks. It includes pages and features for handling student access, teacher and student portals, login/logout workflows, and structured data files — packing essential school operations into one organized project structure. This system is meant both for learning and extending into real deployments for small schools or institutes.

The repository appears to include core frontend and backend files like PHP pages (`index.php`, `login.php`, etc.), database schema (`sms_project.sql`), and organized folders for **admin**, **student**, and **teacher** modules. ([GitHub][1])
